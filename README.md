CoffeeWizz
============
Coffeewizz is a fork of Alistair's awesome MouseJiggler. It comes with minimal changes, primarily to reduce the risk of people noticing what kind of software you're using.

## Changes
- Replaced the program title "MouseJiggler" with "CoffeeWizz"
- Changed program icon to unsuspicious office logo
- Start program minimized
- Replaced the notifyIcon's tooltips with unsuspicous text (e.g. "Office Update")
- Changed button order & size for improved usability
- Start main form minimized when restoring from notify icon
